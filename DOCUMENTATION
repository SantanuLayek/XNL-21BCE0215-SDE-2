The DataStream platform is a high-performance, secure, and scalable solution for processing financial data and transactions in real-time. With its event-driven microservices architecture, advanced analytics, and cloud-native deployment, it ensures efficiency, security, and real-time data accuracy for traders and financial analysts.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
The DataStream platform is built using a cutting-edge technology stack optimized for real-time financial data processing, high-frequency trading, and scalable microservices deployment. The architecture leverages cloud-native, event-driven, and containerized solutions to ensure low latency, security, and fault tolerance. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key technologies used in the project.
________________________________________
1. Backend Technologies (Microservices & APIs)
The backend is structured using microservices architecture with independent services for user authentication, order matching, market data processing, and financial analytics. Each microservice is containerized and communicates via gRPC and RESTful APIs.
•	Languages & Frameworks:
o	Golang – Used for the Order Matching Engine (OME) due to its high concurrency support and low-latency processing.
o	Node.js (Express.js) – Handles GraphQL APIs for frontend data retrieval.
o	Python (FastAPI) – Implements predictive analytics & risk assessment models.
•	API Development:
o	GraphQL (Apollo Server) – Enables efficient querying and federated API access.
o	RESTful APIs – Standardized for external integrations.
o	WebSockets – Provides real-time market data streaming.
•	Inter-Service Communication:
o	gRPC – Ensures low-latency communication between microservices.
o	Kafka / NATS Streaming – Implements event-driven data pipelines for market transactions.

2. Frontend Technologies
The frontend is built using Next.js, ensuring server-side rendering (SSR) for performance optimization.
•	Frameworks & UI:
o	Next.js (React-based) – Provides fast, dynamic, and SEO-friendly UI.
o	TypeScript – Enhances type safety and code maintainability.
o	Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui – Ensures a clean, modern UI.
o	Framer Motion – Adds smooth animations for an enhanced UX.
•	Real-Time Data Handling:
o	Uses WebSockets to subscribe to live market updates.
o	Displays real-time charts & analytics using Recharts & D3.js.
•	Deployment:
o	Hosted on Vercel & Cloudflare Pages for edge-based rendering and CDN acceleration.

3. Database & Data Storage
A combination of SQL and time-series databases ensures efficient storage and querying of financial transactions and market data.
•	PostgreSQL – Stores user data, orders, and transactions with ACID compliance.
•	TimescaleDB – Optimized for high-frequency, time-series market data.
•	Redis – Provides caching for real-time order book updates.
To ensure high availability and fault tolerance:
•	Sharding & Replication are implemented.
•	Event Sourcing & CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) optimize consistency.
